# Introduction to Wyo STEM

In recent years, there has been a rise in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education throughout the United States.  The power of these programs is that not only are these individual fields studied but the overlap, the application, and the vital skills to actually get something done are all a part of it.  Historically, well educated students have been woefully unprepared to actually do things.  The expectation was that when you hired a new graduate, you then had to take the time to train and educate them on how to do the job.  Many of the missing skills were common to nearly all jobs.  Things like project management, scoping, prototyping, and communication were all vital skills missing from these new graduates.

We are seeing a shift in expectations from both employers and from colleges.  These skills that come with experience are sought-out and in some cases even expected.  There was a time that a strong GPA and high scores were enough to win admission to the college of your choosing.  This is no longer the case, schools now want to see demonstrations of success and experience.

# Introduction to Wyo STEM

In recent years, there has been a rise in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education throughout the United States.  The power of these programs is that not only are these individual fields studied but the overlap, the application, and the vital skills to actually get something done are all a part of it.  Historically, well educated students have been woefully unprepared to actually do things.  The expectation was that when you hired a new graduate, you then had to take the time to train and educate them on how to do the job.  Many of the missing skills were common to nearly all jobs.  Things like project management, scoping, prototyping, and communication were all vital skills missing from these new graduates.

We are seeing a shift in expectations from both employers and from colleges.  These skills that come with experience are sought-out and in some cases even expected.  There was a time that a strong GPA and high scores were enough to win admission to the college of your choosing.  This is no longer the case, schools now want to see these types of experiences from their applicants.

## Our Goal

The goal of Wyo STEM is to actively support the school district in the expansion of STEM offerrings.  The school district has some terrific general plans outlined.  To implement these plans is a challenging process.  Our hope is we can leverage our members in many ways to support this progress in the district.  This could take the form of our members' business and technology expertise, financial support, or volunteering in the schools.

## Current STEM Offerings

Currently, the STEM Offerings across the three schools are:

### WHEC (grades K-4)

- Snapology (Extracurricular)
- Summer STEAM Academy (Extracurricular)

### WREC (grades 5-6)

- Summer STEAM Academy (Extracurricular)

### Jr/Sr High (grades 7-12)

- STEM Robotics Computer Science Course (1st semester)
- STEM Robotics Independent Study (2nd semester)

## How You Can Help

### Right Now

- Stay informed (get [email updates](https://wyostem.org/join-mailing-list/))
- Positively support our school board and administration as they go through the challenging process of establishing a STEM program
- Let our school board and administration know increasing STEM opportunities is a high priority for you

### Short Term

- A great opportunity to Expose yourself and your children to STEM is the [World Maker Faire](https://wyostem.org/world-maker-faire-bus-trip/) in New York City on Saturday September 23, 2017
- Encourage your children to question how technologies work (and help them find the answer)

### Long Term

- Get involved with Wyo STEM
- Volunteer to help in school and after school with STEM activities

### Celebrate Progress

#### Creative Solutions

While the school district has some great plans slated for the future, they're also committed to providing for students in the short-term.  In that vein, they will be providing some much needed space for STEM classes by utilizing the secondary wrestling room at the high school.  This type of out-of-the-box problem solving is exactly the type of mindset we want to grow in our students.

#### School District STEM Plans

We look forward to celebrating steps towards the overall school vision that includes:

> Develop a Comprehensive STEAM Plan and Curriculum Framework

> Renovate the STEAM Wing in the Junior/Senior High School

> Create Innovation Labs at Wyomissing Hills Elementary Center and West Reading Elementary Center
